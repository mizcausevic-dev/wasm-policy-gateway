# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-12

### Released
- Shipped **wasm-policy-gateway** as a public artifact for teams dealing with answer-engine visibility.
- Packaged the current implementation, documentation, validation flow, and proof surfaces into a repo that can be reviewed by technical and operating stakeholders.
- Clarified the core problem the project is addressing: weak semantic packaging, inconsistent structured data, and poor answer-system discoverability.

### Why this mattered
- Existing approaches in SEO crawlers, analytics platforms, and schema validators were useful for parts of the workflow.
- They still left out a review layer that connected technical content hygiene with answer readiness and citation potential.
- This release made the repo read like an operational capability rather than a narrow technical demo.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-14

### Shipped
- Cut the first coherent internal version of **wasm-policy-gateway** with stable domain objects, review surfaces, and decision outputs.
- Established the first reviewable version of the architecture described as: Edge policy gateway: pure-Rust geo + rate-limit + A/B routing engine, compiled to WASI (wasm32-wasip1, ~128KB). Runs in Wasmtime, Fastly Compute, Cloudflare Workers via WASM components. Deterministic, fuzzable, portable.
- Focused the repo around actionability instead of passive reporting.

## [Prototype] - 2025-06-16

### Built
- Built the first runnable prototype for the repo's main workflow and decision model.
- Validated the concept against pressure points such as answer-engine discoverability gaps, thin structured data, and inconsistent entity linking.
- Used the prototype phase to test whether the project could drive action, not just present information.

## [Design Phase] - 2022-11-10

### Designed
- Defined the system around operator-first and decision-legible outputs.
- Chose interfaces and examples that made sense for growth, search, content, and analytics teams.
- Avoided reducing the project to a generic dashboard, CRUD app, or fashionable wrapper around the stack.

## [Idea Origin] - 2022-03-10

### Observed
- The original idea surfaced while looking at how teams were handling weak semantic packaging, inconsistent structured data, and poor answer-system discoverability.
- The recurring pattern was that teams had data and tools, but still lacked a usable operating layer for the hardest decisions.

## [Background Signals] - 2022-08-09

### Context
- Earlier platform, governance, and operator-tooling work made one pattern hard to ignore: the systems that create the most drag are often the ones with partial controls and weak operational coherence, not the ones with no controls at all.
- That pattern shaped the thinking behind this repo well before the public version existed.
